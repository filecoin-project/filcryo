# :ice_cube: Filcryo

```sh
docker pull filecoin/filcryo
```

Filcryo is used to freeze chunks of the Filecoin chain with all nutritional
properties (archival grade quality). They can then be cooked with
[Filet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filet).

This project first and foremost aim is to create archival-grade snapshots as
used by the Sentinel/Data Engineering Team at Protocol Labs for further
processing. It is meant to "just work" for this and be as simple and easy to
follow as possible. Generalization or re-usability are secondary concerns as
of now.

Usage, build and deployment information is found in [DOCS.md](DOCS.md).
